# Pear Precision Project Setup - Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Environment Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Python virtual environment
- [x] Install backend dependencies from requirements.txt
- [x] Install Kaggle CLI for dataset downloads

## Phase 2: Data Preparation
- [x] Download pear detection dataset from Kaggle ✅
- [x] Download pear leaf disease dataset for pear detection ✅
- [x] Run dataset preparation scripts ✅

## Phase 3: Model Training
- [x] Train YOLOv8 pear detection model (IN PROGRESS - Epoch 2/80)
- [ ] Train ResNet18 leaf classifier model
- [ ] Generate confusion matrix for evaluation

## Phase 4: Application Launch
- [ ] Start FastAPI backend server
- [ ] Open frontend in browser for testing

## Notes:
- Kaggle API setup completed successfully
- Model training may take significant time depending on hardware
- Ensure sufficient storage space for datasets and models
